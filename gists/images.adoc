:imagesdir: assets

Let's try out using the `imagesdir` attribute to point out the location of our images.
For the full details see the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#set-the-images-directory[Asciidoctor user manual].

In our case, the images are located in the `assets` directory, so this is what goes into the document header:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:imagesdir: assets
----

We include the image the usual way:

[source,asciidoc]
----
image::Tux.svg[]
----

And here's the rendering:

image::Tux.svg[]
