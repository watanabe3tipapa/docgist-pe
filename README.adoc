DocGist is a URL proxy tool that converts AsciiDoc documents fetched from Gists (http://gist.github.com), GitHub repositories, Dropbox folders and other sources to HTML.
The conversion to HTML is performed in the browser (client-side) using the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.js[Asciidoctor.js] JavaScript library

NOTE: DocGist is a hosted alternative to the Asciidoctor.js Live Preview extension for Chrome.
